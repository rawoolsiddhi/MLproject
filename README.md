# Student Math Score Prediction

This project aims to predict students' math scores using machine learning techniques. It's built using Python with `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `Flask` for model development and web deployment.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess student data.
- **Modeling**: Train ML models to predict scores.
- **Web App**: A Flask-based interface to interact with predictions.

## Installation
